concurrencetopology
===================

"Concurrence topology" is a method for describing high-order statistical dependence among binary variables.

The software described here was used for the computations described in the paper "Describing high-order statistical dependence using 'Concurrence Topology', with application to functional MRI brain data" by Ellis and Klein (2014).

Please see the website http://binarybottle.com/concurrencetopology/ for more information and supplementary materials.

This repository contains the concurrence software as an R file called "ConcurrenceTopology.RData", and supplemental examples in an R file called "TestPatterns.RData".
